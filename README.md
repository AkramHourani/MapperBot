# MapperBot / iSCAN: 
SLAM Robot and Algorithm based on Matlab and Arduino

Robot name: MapperBot  
Algorithm name: iSCAN

# MapperBot
The source files for the Arduino are inside the folder \ArduinoSourceCode  
Hardware layout and photo inside the folder \HardwareDesign
The file “A01_MapperBot_Mouse.m” will allow you to control MapperBot using a mouse from Matlab environment.

# iSCAN Algorithm
For details please read the full paper describing the  algorithm and the robot’s function.  
The project indludes three sample LIDAR row data collected using MapperBot. To run the demo: \iSCAN\main.m  
You can change the algorithm parameters under in the file “\iSCAN\Parameters.m”  

The project is developped by Dr Akram Al-Hourani (2019)
