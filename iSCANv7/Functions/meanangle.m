function [out] = meanangle(in,dim,sens)

% MEANANGLE will calculate the mean of a set of angles (in radians) based
% on polar considerations.
%
% Usage: [out] = meanangle(in,dim)
%
% in is a vector or matrix of angles (in radians)
% out is the mean of these angles along the dimension dim
%
% If dim is not specified, the first non-singleton dimension is used.
%
% A sensitivity factor is used to determine oppositeness, and is how close
% the mean of the complex representations of the angles can be to zero
% before being called zero.  For nearly all cases, this parameter is fine
% at its default (1e-12), but it can be readjusted as a third parameter if
% necessary:
%
% [out] = meanangle(in,dim,sensitivity)
